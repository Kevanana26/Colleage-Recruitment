            this Webiste is for!
            To help incoming Freshies that are interested in going to Rutgers, The first thing freshman might question
            about the living conditions there. For freshman you could either go to the schol and then go back home, or
            you could live on campus in shared apartments.
            On-campus housing offers furnished rooms in shared apartments, and students have access to computer labs,
            study lounges, and housing staff. If that dosen't sound appealing, you could try the Living-Learning
            Communites
            Living-Learning Communities is when Students co-enroll in common courses and live in the same residence
            hall. These communities are a good option for students who are undecided about their major or want to
            explore a specific academic topic.
            There is also the Helyar House which is a cooperative living environment that was originally set up for male
            students, but became co-ed in 2002. There's also the Pharmacy and Nursing Living-Learning community, which

            and other foods, but they also have what they call "Fat Sandwiches" Which are sandwiches that have a variety
